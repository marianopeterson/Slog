* Reverse commits (show most recent at top)
    Currently you scan commits bottom-up,
    then read comments within the commit top-down.
    This is counter intuitive and makes its hard to read.

* Add diff command
    slog diff -rNNN -- where NNN is the revision whose changes you want to review

* Allow multiple match authors to be specified on the CLI.
    e.g.,   --author=foo,bar
            --author foo bar
            -a foo bar
            -a=foo bar
